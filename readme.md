# Cross-platform Mobile Tools Compared

The following compares three "native" cross-platform mobile development tools: Appcelerator Titanium, Telerik NativeScript, and Facebook ReactNative. Each of these tools promises the features needed to let you build a native, cross-platform mobile app with JavaScript. 

It is **not**:

* a comprehensive review of these tools.
* a comparison of all tools available.
* an endorsement of any one tool vs another.
* a tutorial.
* a comparison of web wrapper (e.g. Cordova-type) tools.

## Comparison Table

**Key:**

* &#x2705; - yes, supports
* &#x274e; = mostly yes, some missing features
* &#x26d4; - mostly no
* &#x274c; - no / not at all
* &#x2753; - unknown
* &#x2757; - yes, warning

An interesting project to watch is [react-titanium](https://github.com/yuchi/react-titanium) which is a custom React renderer for Titanium. In theory, this would give you a mix of benefits of those two tools.

**Footnotes**

* <sup>1</sup> - Just released and somewhat at an alpha state
* <sup>2</sup> - "Coming soon" per their web site
* <sup>3</sup> - Meaning, a single means for creating basic UI components that masks basic differences in the native APIs
* <sup>4</sup> - The closed-source Hyperloop module enables direct access on iOS and Windows, though has limitations currently. Otherwise, you can create a "native module" to expose the native APIs to the Titanium layer.
* <sup>5</sup> - LiveView (from Appcelerator) and TiShadow (community) offers whole-app-reload rather than live reload of the "current screen"
* <sup>6</sup> - Eclipsed-based IDE available to subscribers only; community-created options to support Sublime, Atom, TextMate, etc.
* <sup>7</sup> - Telerik offers plug-ins for Visual Studio and Sublime. They also offer an online code editor and build tools.
* <sup>8</sup> - Atom-based IDE is reported to be in development; community-created plug-ins available.
* <sup>9</sup> - In essence, ReactNative is just the "V" of MVC
* <sup>10</sup> - Appcelerator publishes their current SDK to only subscribers. OSS/community members have access to one-prior releases (so if current version is 5.1.0.GA, OSS members get access to 5.0.0.GA). OSS users can compile the current SDK from source or use a <a href="http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#master" target="_blank">CI build</a>.

##Disclosure

I used to work for Appcelerator (as lead trainer and later as an engineer). In part, I prepared this chart to help me overcome the natural bias and myopia that comes from working for a company for four years. The info here is as unbiased as I can make it, given my background. It is not meant to endorse or promote any of these tools over another. Please make your own *informed* choice.
